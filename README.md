# Gmail Suspicious Keyword Alert Extension

A lightweight Chrome Extension that scans the **subject titles of emails in Gmail** for suspicious keywords defined by you. If a keyword is detected in an email title, the extension will **highlight the email in red** and **display an alert message**, helping you stay vigilant against phishing and suspicious emails.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The extension reads the subject line (title) of each visible email in Gmail.
2. It compares them to a list of **user-defined suspicious words** stored in Chrome's local storage.
3. If a word is matched:
   - The email subject turns **red** and **bold**.
   - A red alert (`🔴 Suspicious: "word"`) is appended next to the subject.
4. You can manage the suspicious words using the simple interface popup.
